# Savings calculator
Savings calculator written in Java with the help of JavaFx for the user interface.
You can change monthly savings, interest rate and period (in years) by dragging sliders' thumbs and the line chart will automatically recalculate savings without taking into account interest rate (i.e. interest rate 0%) and taking into account interest rate.
